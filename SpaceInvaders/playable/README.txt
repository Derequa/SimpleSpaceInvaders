Derek Batts - CSC 481 - Fall 2015 - Homework 3

To play this import the zipped project into eclipse, run the server through the GameManager class, and the client
through the Client class.

Controls:
    W - move up / tap to jump
    A - move left
    D = move right
    
Replays:
    When the Client class is run, a GUI will appear that will have controls for recording a replay.
    You can record a replay by clicking "Start Recording" and you can stop recording by clicking "Stop Recording".
    When you stop recording your first replay, a new PApplet window will appear to view your replays on whileyou continue to play.
    When you have a replay recorded, you can play it by clicking "Play" and pause it by clicking "Pause".
    When a replay is playing you can change the playback speed by clicking on one of the speed buttons.
    The "1/2 Speed" button slows down the repay to half speed.
    The "2x Speed" button speeds up the repay to double speed.
    The "Default Speed" button sets the repay to realtime speed.
    Once the replay has finished playing, the viewer will go blank. The replay can be restarted with the restart button.
    The replay will then start playing at the speed (if any) it was when it finished.
    If you wish to record another replay, simply click "Start Recording" again, but watch out, this will overwrite your last replay.
    Be warned: if you close the client, replay GUI or replay viewer all the open windows associated with this client will close.
